  <h2 className='c mt-4'>Website Builders</h2>
  <p className='cc'> <strong>
  As opposed to third-party agency websites, website builders offer a little more flexibility for customization. Common examples of website builders are Wix (this is what HAR recommends), SquareSpace, Weebly 2, and GoDaddy.

If you want to fast-track this process, we generally recommend that newbies create a travel agency website via Wix. Why? Because Wix is user-friendly and you can create your travel agency website in 7 minutes flat. (No Joke. We have a video to prove it.)

But we understand you're here to shop around :) There's a lot of great programs out there that allow you to easily build your own professional-looking website with no coding knowledge necessary. Here are the top website builders advisors reported using in 2021.

  <p className='cc'> <strong>
  Want to personalize their travel agency website with their own structure and content
Don’t mind putting in the work themselves to create a website for their travel agency'
They're the happy medium between 3rd-party sites and 100% custom jobs (more on that later). They offer more opportunities for customization (incorporating your own branding, design, and content) without sacrificing ease of use.

    <h2 className='c mt-4'>CONTENT</h2>
  <p className='cc'> <strong>
  Travel agency websites built with website builders like Wix and Squarespace will require that you write your own content, create your own pages and structure it accordingly. The templates usually have layouts with dummy text to give you an idea of a typical website layout with what type of information a page can hold but it isn’t usable content. If you don’t want to write content, you can pay extra for a content writer.

    <h2 className='c mt-4'>SEO</h2>
  <p className='cc'> <strong>
  This is an area where website builders have really advanced over the last few years. There is still a stigma around website builders and bad SEO that arose from their early days but rest assured, you can have a successful, ranking travel agency website on a website builder platform. The SEO edits we mention above are doable with most website builders. WebsiteToolTester.com has a super helpful chart that shows the specific SEO capabilities of the different website builders.
